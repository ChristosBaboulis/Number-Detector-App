This program takes as an input a sorted Array and counts how many times a given number x (8 in this state)
appears inside the array, using O(logn) complexity

TODO:
- The file containing the array needs to be named "1-sm.txt" in .txt form
- The file must contain only numbers sorted and distinguished through space (e.g. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13)

Running through:
- cmd (move "1-sm.txt" file to same folder with class)
- Intellij
